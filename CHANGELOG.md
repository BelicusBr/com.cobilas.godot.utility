- **Stream Behavior**: Modified stream read operations to preserve position and reset to beginning when reading entire content
- **Enum Values**: Updated `ArchiveAttributes` to use proper hexadecimal values and standard .NET attributes

## [7.0.0] - 2025-10-28
### Added
- **New IO System**: Completely new file system abstraction supporting both Godot virtual file system and system file system
- **Stream Architecture**: New stream-based IO system with `IStream`, `IArchiveStream`, and `IGodotArchiveStream` interfaces
- **Folder Management**: New `IFolderInfo` interface for comprehensive folder operations
- **Archive Management**: New `IArchiveInfo` interface for file operations with copy/move functionality

## [6.3.1] (23/10/2025)
### Changed
- Bumped package version to 6.3.1 in the project file (`com.cobilas.godot.utility.csproj`).
- Packaging: enabled generation of symbol package (.snupkg) and portable PDBs (`IncludeSymbols`, `SymbolPackageFormat=snupkg`, `DebugType=portable`). `GeneratePackageOnBuild` now enabled only for Release builds.
- Moved folder-tree construction logic into a dedicated internal `FolderBuilder` class to centralize and simplify `Folder` creation.

### Added
- `ArchiveInfo` and `FolderInfo` structs implementing `IDataInfo` (provide timestamps, `IsInternal` and `IsGodotRoot`).
- `FolderBuilder` internal helper that creates `Folder` and `Archive` trees from both Godot resource paths (`res://`) and filesystem/user paths (`user://`).
- `Folder.SetDataList(Folder, DataBase[]?)` internal accessor to allow the builder to inject constructed children without exposing internals.

### Fixed
- `GodotPath.GetDirectoryName` now correctly preserves Godot special roots (`res://`, `user://`) and maps truncated results (`res:`, `user:`) to the proper prefixes.
- `Archive` buffer refresh logic: added `_LastWriteTime` tracking and checks to avoid unnecessary reloads; respects internal Godot resources and release/debug feature flags.
- `Folder` / `FolderNode`: improved initialization and enumeration of files/folders; added `GetFolders` and `GetFiles` enumerables.
- Extensive XML documentation added across the IO module; several members were marked nullable where appropriate (notably `IDataInfo?`).

### Breaking changes / compatibility notes
- `DataInfo` became nullable (`IDataInfo?`) in core types (`DataBase`, `Archive`, `Folder`, `FolderNode`). Update callers to guard against null (e.g. `if (data.DataInfo?.IsInternal ?? false)`).
- The project `DefineConstants` were adjusted in the csproj: note `RELEASE` is now present in some Debug definitions in this commit — verify if intentional.

### Migration tips
- Replace direct `DataInfo` access with null-aware checks or ensure `DataInfo` is assigned before using.
- Build packages in Release when publishing to ensure optimized assemblies and correct packaging of `.nupkg`/`.snupkg`.
- If you rely on old `GetDirectoryName` truncation behavior, update your code to use `GodotPath` helpers instead.

## [6.2.3] (15/10/2025)
### Fixed
**Identified Issue:**
The `GetDirectoryName` method exhibited incorrect behavior when processing special Godot paths, returning truncated values ​​such as "res:" and "user:" instead of the expected full paths.

**Technical Description:**
- **Affected Method:** `public static string GetDirectoryName(string path)`
- **Defect Scenario:** When receiving paths with Godot prefixes ("res://" and "user://")
- **Previous Behavior:** Returned "res:" and "user:" (incorrect truncation)
- **Expected Behavior:** Maintained the full prefixes of special paths

**Root Cause:**
The method directly used .NET's `Path.GetDirectoryName`, which does not recognize Godot-specific URL schemes, resulting in improper truncation of the prefixes.

**Implemented Solution:**
Replaced the direct implementation with an intelligent substitution system that:
- Preserves default behavior for conventional paths
- Specifically detects and handles "res:" and "user:" cases
- Maps to the appropriate constants (`res_path` and `user_path`)

**Impact of the Fix:**
- ✓ Correctly preserves Godot's special paths
- ✓ Maintains compatibility with conventional system paths
- ✓ Improved interoperability between file systems
- ✓ Prevents errors in subsequent operations that rely on full paths

**Area of ​​Impact:**
- Manipulation of project resources (res://)
- Access to user data (user://)
- File system operations that use Godot paths

## [6.2.2] (15/10/2025)
### Fixed
**Problem:** The `Vector2D` properties (`Pivot`, `Scale`, `MinSize`, `Size` and `Position`) were throwing `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` due to an error in initializing the `Vector2D` structure.

**Root Cause:**
- The `Vector2D` structure was being initialized incorrectly in the internal `InitVector2D` method
- The code was assigning the value of the X axis (`x`) to both index 0 and index 2, leaving the Y axis (`y`) uninitialized
- This affected all properties that depended on these vectors and any methods that used them

**Implemented Solution:**
- Fixed the `InitVector2D` method to correctly initialize both axes:
  - Index 0: X axis (`x`)
  - Index 1: Y axis (`y`)
- Eliminated the incorrect assignment to index 2 (nonexistent in `Vector2D`)

**Impact:**
- Fixed `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` in all operations involving vector properties
- Restored correct operation of methods that depend on these properties
- Improved overall stability of 2D geometry manipulation

## [6.2.1] (08/10/2025)
### Fixed
- Made the `Gizmos.Color` property public again in the Gizmos class

### Changed
- Added modulus calculation methods to vector structures
- Fixed documentation comments for `Quaternion.Rad2Deg` and `Quaternion.Deg2Rad` constants (previously swapped)
- Marked `Rect2_GD_CB_Extension.Contains` as obsolete since it duplicates `Rect2.HasPoint(Vector2)` functionality

### Added
- **Extension Methods**:
  - `Rect2_GD_CB_Extension.Width(this Rect2)` - Gets the width of a Rect2
  - `Rect2_GD_CB_Extension.Height(this Rect2)` - Gets the height of a Rect2
  - **Quaternion Direction Generation**:

    - `GenerateDirectionRight()` - Generates right direction
    - `GenerateDirectionUp()` - Generates up direction  
    - `GenerateDirectionForward()` - Generates forward direction
    - `GenerateDirectionLeft()` - Generates left direction
    - `GenerateDirectionDown()` - Generates down direction
    - `GenerateDirectionBack()` - Generates back direction

- **Vector Modulus Operators**:

  - `Vector2D % float`, `Vector2D % Vector2`, `Vector2D % Vector2D`
  - `Vector2DInt % int`, `Vector2DInt % Vector2DInt`
  - `Vector3DInt % int`, `Vector3DInt % Vector3DInt`

- **UI Extension Methods**:
  - Comprehensive text manipulation extensions for `Label`, `Control`, `Sprite`, and `TextEdit` classes
  - Includes Append, Insert, Remove, Replace, ClearText, and formatting methods
  - Uses shared StringBuilder for performance in frequent text operations

- **Enhanced Rectangle Structure**:
  - Added `Rect2D` structure as an enhanced version of Godot's Rect2
  - Provides additional properties for Control-derived classes and Sprite
  - Includes rotation, scale, pivot, and minimum size support
  - Advanced point detection considering transformations

The update focuses on expanding mathematical utilities, improving UI component functionality, and providing more comprehensive color and transformation handling for Godot Engine development.

## [6.1.2] (06/10/2025)
### Fixed
The extension method `Camera2D_GD_CB_Extension.WorldToScreenPoint(this Camera2D, Vector2D)` had a convention problem where the method did not consider the zoom of the 2D camera.

## [6.1.1] (03/10/2025)
### Added
The `Node_GD_CB_Extension.SetParent(this Node?, Node?)` extension method was added to the Node class.

### Fixed
The `InputKeyBoard.DoubleClick` property had an issue with remaining true while the mouse button was held down because the property was not reset correctly.

### Changed
The `CoroutineManager` class has been converted to an internal class, and its methods such as `StartCoroutine(IEnumerator?)`, `StopCoroutine(Coroutine?)`, and `StopAllCoroutines()` can now be accessed by the Coroutine class. \
The `SceneManager`, `Gizmos`, `Physics2D`, and `InputKeyBoard` classes no longer inherit from the `Node` class and have become static classes. This was done so that these classes do not inherit methods or fields that derive from the Node class.

### Removed
Deprecated classes such as `GDDirectory`, `GDFile`, `GDFileBase`, and `GDIONull` have been removed. Use classes such as `Archive` and `Folder` to access folders and files.

## [5.1.1] (18/09/2025)
### Fixed
The `NodePath_GD_CB_Extension.GetNode(NodePath?)` extension method could encounter a 'path not found' issue because the extension method does not correctly handle relative paths.

## [5.1.0-ch.2;5.1.0] (24-26/08/2025)
### Changed
This push was focused on resolving possible null references and documenting classes or methods.

## [5.1.0-ch.1] (21/08/2025)
### Added
Two attributes, `ExportRangeAttribute` and `RunInEditorAttribute`, have been added.
Extensions for the `Godot.Object` and `Godot.Vector2` classes.
The methods `Node_GD_CB_Extension.Duplicate<T>(this Node, int) where T : Node`, `Node_GD_CB_Extension.ContainsNode(this Node, Node)`,
`Vector2_CB_GD_Extensions.Neg(this Vector2, bool, bool)`, and `Rect2_GD_CB_Extension.Contains(this Rect2, in Vector2D)` have been added to the extension classes.

#### ExportRangeAttribute
Allows integer or floating-point values ​​to take on a Range element format in the Godot inspector.

#### RunInEditorAttribute
This attribute has the same function as ToolAttribute.

### Changed
The `Node_GD_CB_Extension.Print(this Node, params object[])` method has been moved to the `Object_CB_GD_Extension` extension class.

## [5.0.0] (16/02/2025)
#### Added
- **`Folder` class:** Introduced to replace the `GDDirectory` class. The new `Folder` class offers optimized methods for manipulating directories and files within the Godot project, providing greater efficiency and usability.
- **`Archive` class:** Replaces the `GDFile` class, with improved functionality for file management, including reading and writing data.
- **`GodotPath` class:** Added to make path manipulation in Godot easier. `GodotPath` allows for path merging and verification operations.

#### Deprecate
- **`GDDirectory` class:** Declared obsolete and replaced by the new `Folder` class. All old methods are now implemented more efficiently in the `Folder` class.
- **`GDFile` class:** Marked as obsolete and replaced by the `Archive` class. The new `Archive` class inherits the functionality of `GDFile`, with significant improvements.

#### Removed
- **`GDFileAttributes` enum:** Removed from the package and replaced with the `ArchiveAttributes` enum, which offers a more comprehensive set of attributes and is better aligned with the new `Archive` class.

#### Changed
- **Relocation of serialization classes:** Classes such as `BuildSerialization`, responsible for property serialization, have been moved to the `Cobilas.GodotEditor.Utility.Serialization` namespace. This change better organizes the code and improves the modularity of the project.

## [4.8.1] (13/02/2025)
### Fixed
#### SerializationCache
There was a problem creating cache files due to the use of the `Node.GetPathTo(Node)` method, which was used incorrectly, resulting in the same cache being used in game and editor mode. \
The solution was to create two caches for each mode where the editor cache is copied to the player cache.

## [4.8.0] (13/02/2025)
### Added
#### PlayModeStateChange
The package now provides the `RunTimeInitialization.PlayModeStateChanged` event that allows you to check which mode the editor is in, whether the editor is entering or exiting game or editor mode.

## [4.7.1] (23/01/2025)
### Fixed
#### System.Number.ThrowOverflowOrFormatException
The `PrimitiveTypeCustom.CacheValueToObject(string?, string?)` method had a `System.Number.ThrowOverflowOrFormatException` issue caused by some extensions of the `String_CB_Extension` class.

#### Single cache
Now the cache has been separated for editor mode and player mode to prevent editor and simulation mode from changing the same cache file.

#### Extra cache check
An extra property name comparison check has been added to the `Get` and `Set` methods.

## [4.7.0] (23/01/2025)
### Added

`Color32` represents an `rgba` value between 0 and 255. \
`ColorF` represents a normalized `rgba` value between 0 and 1f.

## [4.6.1] (23/01/2025)
### Fixed
The formatting of the `Vector4D` structure in the `ToString()` method where the `w` axis was not displayed, instead the `z` axis was displayed.

### Added
#### Custom hint
Now `SerializeField` attributes in their parameters can receive `CustomHint`.

## [4.5.1] (19/01/2025)
### Fixed
#### Get members of a type
The `BuildSerialization.Build` method had the problem of searching for the members of the type but did not search for the members of the types inherited by the child class, which caused inherited members not to be serialized in the editor.

#### Converting json values
The `PropertyCustom` class in the `PropertyCustom.CacheValueToObject(string?, string?)` method may throw a `FormatException` because it does not handle an empty json value.

## [4.5.0] (16/01/2025)
### Changed
The `BuildSerialization.Build(Godot.Object)` method now accepts objects of type `Godot.Node` and `Godot.Resource`.

### Added
Now objects of type `Enum` have a `PropertyCustom` class. \
The `PropertyCustomAttribute` attribute allows the use of parent classes for child classes.

## [4.4.1] (13/01/2025)
### Fixed
The `SONull` and `SPCNull` classes had inherited members that returned `System.NotImplementedException` which caused problems when creating an instance of these classes.

## [4.4.0] (08/01/2025)
### Added
#### Custom serialization
Now a class has been added for custom serialization of properties in the Godot inspector. \
With the `HideProperty` and `ShowProperty` attributes you can serialize properties in the Godot inspector.

## [4.3.0] (26/12/2024)
### Added
#### DebugLog
The `DebugLog` class has been added to provide a way to output trace logs to the godot console.

## [4.2.7] (23/12/2024)
### Fixed
#### Invalid file path
The `GDDirectory.GetGDDirectory(string)` method was creating invalid paths for files and directories for representations which resulted in directory or file not found errors.

## [4.2.5] (18/11/2024)
### Fixed
#### Correction of MouseButton enum values
`MouseButton.MouseRight` now has the correct value of 2 (previously 1). \
`MouseButton.MouseLeft` now has the correct value of 1 (previously 2). \
This fix resolves the inversion in mouse trigger detection, ensuring that mouse click events are interpreted correctly.

## [4.2.4] (16/11/2024)
### Changed
#### Dependency update
The `Cobilas.Core.Net4x` dependency of the `Cobilas.Godot.Utility` package has been updated to version `2.0.1`.

## [4.2.3] (14/11/2024)
### Fixed
#### Incorrect resolution
The `Screen.CurrentResolution` property had the problem of returning the full screen resolution without considering other screen modes.
#### Problems with vector and quaternion interpolation
All vector and quaternion structures had a problem of `ArgumentNullException` when inserted into an interpolated string. \
This could occur when the `format` parameter of the `IFormattable.ToString(string, IFormatProvider)` will be null.

## [4.2.1] (14/11/2024)
### Fixed
#### NullReferenceException in Screen class
Private `Screen.AddResolution` function always emitted a `NullReferenceException` because it does not correct the parameter if it is null and void or not.

## [4.2.0] (12/11/2024)
### Added

The `Inputkeyboard.Deltascroll` property always returned positive values by misunderstanding inputs reeiers

## [4.1.1] (11/11/2024)
### Fixed
#### NullReferenceException in Gizmos._Process(float)
The method uses a private variable to update the drawing method but the `Gizm._Process(float)` method did not verify if variable was null.

## [4.1.0] (29/10/2024 - 04/11/2024)
### Added
#### IYieldCoroutine.IsLastCoroutine property

#### Details
Since `Randomico.value` was of field type, this made the return of pseudorandom methods static.

## [1.5.2] (17/09/2024)
### Fixed
`StackOverflowException` in `Vector2D.Magnitude(in Vector2D)`
#### Details
The `Vector2D.Magnitude(in Vector2D)` method raised `StackOverflowException` by calling itself.

## [1.5.1] (12/09/2024)
### Add
Vector Structure.
#### Details
Vector structures such as 2d, 3d, 4d, and quaternion vectors have been added.

### Fixed
`ArgumentNullException` in `GDDirectory.GetGDDirectory()` method.
#### Details
The `GDDirectory.GetGDDirectory()` method always raised an `ArgumentNullException` due to the fact that the `GDDirectory.GetGDDirectory()` method uses the private `GDDirectory.GetGDDirectory(string, GDFileBase)` method, which received a null value in the parent parameter, but that, as of version `1.4.0`, the parent parameter of the GDDirectory class constructor is now checked if it is null, which caused the `GDDirectory.GetGDDirectory()` method to break.

## [1.4.0] (04/08/2024)
### Add
The `Randomico` and `GDIONull` classes.
#### Details
The `Randomico` class was added for pseudorandom value generation. \

## [1.2.2] (06/07/2024)
### Changed
Dependency `Cobilas.Core.Net4x@1.1.0` has been updated to version `1.6.1`.
### Fixed
Method not found
#### Details
The `Method not found` exception was caused by the `Cobilas.Core.Net4x` dependency not being updated.

## [30/12/2023]##1.1.1
### Fixed
Methods that use the private method `Array CreateExclude(CollisionObject2D[]);` had the null reference problem.
This occurred when the `Array CreateExclude(CollisionObject2D[]);` method received an empty list which caused the method to return a null list of type `Godot.Collections.Array`.
## Added
The CHANGELOG.md file has been added.
### Changed
The com.cobilas.godot.utility.csproj file has been changed.
## [31/12/2023]##1.1.2
### Fixed
O An exception of type `InvalidCastexception` in the explicit operator of the `Hit2D` structure where the `Collision` property could receive an object of another type than `CollisionObject2D` which would inevitably cause `InvalidCastexception`.
The explicit operator of the `RayHit2D` structure was also changed to avoid the same problem as the explicit operator of the `Hit2D` structure.
## [31/12/2023]##1.2.0
### Added
The `Gizmos` class has been added.
The `Gizmos` class allows you to use drawing functions statically.
## [01/01/2024]##1.2.1
### Fixed
In the static constructor of the `Screen` class it only obtained the resolutions saved in the <kbd>res://AddResolution.json</kbd> file but with the correction the <kbd>projectrootfolder://AddResolution.json</kbd> file in the root folder of the already compiled project is also obtained.
