# [6.2.1] (08/10/2025)
## Fixed
The Gizmos class had its `Gizmos.Color` property set to public again.

## Changed
Now vectors have methods for calculating modulus.

## Added
Extension methods like `Rect2_GD_CB_Extension.Width(this Rect2)` and `Rect2_GD_CB_Extension.Height(this Rect2)` have been added as well as the methods `Quaternion.GenerateDirection(Vector3D)`, `Quaternion.GenerateDirectionRight()`, `Quaternion.GenerateDirectionUp()`, `Quaternion.GenerateDirectionForward()`, `Quaternion.GenerateDirectionLeft()`, `Quaternion.GenerateDirectionDown()` and `Quaternion.GenerateDirectionBack()` have been added as well.

# [6.1.2] (06/10/2025)
## Fixed
The extension method `Camera2D_GD_CB_Extension.WorldToScreenPoint(this Camera2D, Vector2D)` had a convention problem where the method did not consider the zoom of the 2D camera.

# [6.1.1] (03/10/2025)
## Added
The `Node_GD_CB_Extension.SetParent(this Node?, Node?)` extension method was added to the Node class.

## Fixed
The `InputKeyBoard.DoubleClick` property had an issue with remaining true while the mouse button was held down because the property was not reset correctly.

## Changed
The `CoroutineManager` class has been converted to an internal class, and its methods such as `StartCoroutine(IEnumerator?)`, `StopCoroutine(Coroutine?)`, and `StopAllCoroutines()` can now be accessed by the Coroutine class. \
The `SceneManager`, `Gizmos`, `Physics2D`, and `InputKeyBoard` classes no longer inherit from the `Node` class and have become static classes. This was done so that these classes do not inherit methods or fields that derive from the Node class.

## Removed
Deprecated classes such as `GDDirectory`, `GDFile`, `GDFileBase`, and `GDIONull` have been removed. Use classes such as `Archive` and `Folder` to access folders and files.

# [5.1.1] (18/09/2025)
## Fixed
The `NodePath_GD_CB_Extension.GetNode(NodePath?)` extension method could encounter a 'path not found' issue because the extension method does not correctly handle relative paths.

# [5.1.0-ch.2;5.1.0] (24-26/08/2025)
## Changed
This push was focused on resolving possible null references and documenting classes or methods.

# [5.1.0-ch.1] (21/08/2025)
## Added
Two attributes, `ExportRangeAttribute` and `RunInEditorAttribute`, have been added.
Extensions for the `Godot.Object` and `Godot.Vector2` classes.
The methods `Node_GD_CB_Extension.Duplicate<T>(this Node, int) where T : Node`, `Node_GD_CB_Extension.ContainsNode(this Node, Node)`,
`Vector2_CB_GD_Extensions.Neg(this Vector2, bool, bool)`, and `Rect2_GD_CB_Extension.Contains(this Rect2, in Vector2D)` have been added to the extension classes.

### ExportRangeAttribute
Allows integer or floating-point values ​​to take on a Range element format in the Godot inspector.

### RunInEditorAttribute
This attribute has the same function as ToolAttribute.

## Changed
The `Node_GD_CB_Extension.Print(this Node, params object[])` method has been moved to the `Object_CB_GD_Extension` extension class.

# [5.0.0] (16/02/2025)
### Added
- **`Folder` class:** Introduced to replace the `GDDirectory` class. The new `Folder` class offers optimized methods for manipulating directories and files within the Godot project, providing greater efficiency and usability.
- **`Archive` class:** Replaces the `GDFile` class, with improved functionality for file management, including reading and writing data.
- **`GodotPath` class:** Added to make path manipulation in Godot easier. `GodotPath` allows for path merging and verification operations.

### Deprecate
- **`GDDirectory` class:** Declared obsolete and replaced by the new `Folder` class. All old methods are now implemented more efficiently in the `Folder` class.
- **`GDFile` class:** Marked as obsolete and replaced by the `Archive` class. The new `Archive` class inherits the functionality of `GDFile`, with significant improvements.

### Removed
- **`GDFileAttributes` enum:** Removed from the package and replaced with the `ArchiveAttributes` enum, which offers a more comprehensive set of attributes and is better aligned with the new `Archive` class.

### Changed
- **Relocation of serialization classes:** Classes such as `BuildSerialization`, responsible for property serialization, have been moved to the `Cobilas.GodotEditor.Utility.Serialization` namespace. This change better organizes the code and improves the modularity of the project.

# [4.8.1] (13/02/2025)
## Fixed
### SerializationCache
There was a problem creating cache files due to the use of the `Node.GetPathTo(Node)` method, which was used incorrectly, resulting in the same cache being used in game and editor mode. \
The solution was to create two caches for each mode where the editor cache is copied to the player cache.

# [4.8.0] (13/02/2025)
## Added
### PlayModeStateChange
The package now provides the `RunTimeInitialization.PlayModeStateChanged` event that allows you to check which mode the editor is in, whether the editor is entering or exiting game or editor mode.

# [4.7.1] (23/01/2025)
## Fixed
### System.Number.ThrowOverflowOrFormatException
The `PrimitiveTypeCustom.CacheValueToObject(string?, string?)` method had a `System.Number.ThrowOverflowOrFormatException` issue caused by some extensions of the `String_CB_Extension` class.

### Single cache
Now the cache has been separated for editor mode and player mode to prevent editor and simulation mode from changing the same cache file.

### Extra cache check
An extra property name comparison check has been added to the `Get` and `Set` methods.

# [4.7.0] (23/01/2025)
## Added

# [4.5.1] (19/01/2025)
## Fixed
### Get members of a type
The `BuildSerialization.Build` method had the problem of searching for the members of the type but did not search for the members of the types inherited by the child class, which caused inherited members not to be serialized in the editor.

### Converting json values
The `PropertyCustom` class in the `PropertyCustom.CacheValueToObject(string?, string?)` method may throw a `FormatException` because it does not handle an empty json value.

# [4.5.0] (16/01/2025)
## Changed
The `BuildSerialization.Build(Godot.Object)` method now accepts objects of type `Godot.Node` and `Godot.Resource`.

## Added
Now objects of type `Enum` have a `PropertyCustom` class. \
The `PropertyCustomAttribute` attribute allows the use of parent classes for child classes.

# [4.4.1] (13/01/2025)
## Fixed
The `SONull` and `SPCNull` classes had inherited members that returned `System.NotImplementedException` which caused problems when creating an instance of these classes.

# [4.4.0] (08/01/2025)
## Added
### Custom serialization
Now a class has been added for custom serialization of properties in the Godot inspector. \
With the `HideProperty` and `ShowProperty` attributes you can serialize properties in the Godot inspector.

## Added
### DebugLog
The `DebugLog` class has been added to provide a way to output trace logs to the godot console.

# [4.2.7] (23/12/2024)
## Fixed
### Invalid file path
The `GDDirectory.GetGDDirectory(string)` method was creating invalid paths for files and directories for representations which resulted in directory or file not found errors.

# [4.2.5] (18/11/2024)
## Fixed
### Correction of MouseButton enum values
`MouseButton.MouseRight` now has the correct value of 2 (previously 1). \
`MouseButton.MouseLeft` now has the correct value of 1 (previously 2). \
This fix resolves the inversion in mouse trigger detection, ensuring that mouse click events are interpreted correctly.

# [4.2.4] (16/11/2024)
## Changed
### Dependency update
The `Cobilas.Core.Net4x` dependency of the `Cobilas.Godot.Utility` package has been updated to version `2.0.1`.

# [4.2.3] (14/11/2024)
## Fixed
### Incorrect resolution
The `Screen.CurrentResolution` property had the problem of returning the full screen resolution without considering other screen modes.
### Problems with vector and quaternion interpolation
All vector and quaternion structures had a problem of `ArgumentNullException` when inserted into an interpolated string. \
This could occur when the `format` parameter of the `IFormattable.ToString(string, IFormatProvider)` will be null.

# [4.2.1] (14/11/2024)
## Fixed
### NullReferenceException in Screen class
Private `Screen.AddResolution` function always emitted a `NullReferenceException` because it does not correct the parameter if it is null and void or not.

# [4.2.0] (12/11/2024)

The `Quaternion` structure received an implicit operator from `Quaternion` to `Vector4D`.

# [4.1.2] (12/11/2024)
## Fixed
### Deltascroll always positive
The `Inputkeyboard.Deltascroll` property always returned positive values by misunderstanding inputs reeiers

# [4.1.1] (11/11/2024)
## Fixed
### NullReferenceException in Gizmos._Process(float)
The method uses a private variable to update the drawing method but the `Gizm._Process(float)` method did not verify if variable was null.

# [4.1.0] (29/10/2024 - 04/11/2024)
## Added

## Fixed
`Randomico.value` is now a property.
### Details
Since `Randomico.value` was of field type, this made the return of pseudorandom methods static.

# [1.5.2] (17/09/2024)
## Fixed
`StackOverflowException` in `Vector2D.Magnitude(in Vector2D)`
### Details
The `Vector2D.Magnitude(in Vector2D)` method raised `StackOverflowException` by calling itself.

# [1.5.1] (12/09/2024)
## Add
Vector Structure.
### Details
Vector structures such as 2d, 3d, 4d, and quaternion vectors have been added.

## Fixed
`ArgumentNullException` in `GDDirectory.GetGDDirectory()` method.
### Details
The `GDDirectory.GetGDDirectory()` method always raised an `ArgumentNullException` due to the fact that the `GDDirectory.GetGDDirectory()` method uses the private `GDDirectory.GetGDDirectory(string, GDFileBase)` method, which received a null value in the parent parameter, but that, as of version `1.4.0`, the parent parameter of the GDDirectory class constructor is now checked if it is null, which caused the `GDDirectory.GetGDDirectory()` method to break.

# [1.4.0] (04/08/2024)
## Add
The `Randomico` and `GDIONull` classes.
### Details
The `Randomico` class was added for pseudorandom value generation. \

## Changed
Dependency `Cobilas.Core.Net4x@1.1.0` has been updated to version `1.6.1`.
## Fixed
Method not found
### Details
The `Method not found` exception was caused by the `Cobilas.Core.Net4x` dependency not being updated.

# [30/12/2023]#1.1.1
## Fixed
Methods that use the private method `Array CreateExclude(CollisionObject2D[]);` had the null reference problem.
This occurred when the `Array CreateExclude(CollisionObject2D[]);` method received an empty list which caused the method to return a null list of type `Godot.Collections.Array`.
# Added
The CHANGELOG.md file has been added.
## Changed
The com.cobilas.godot.utility.csproj file has been changed.
# [31/12/2023]#1.1.2
## Fixed
O An exception of type `InvalidCastexception` in the explicit operator of the `Hit2D` structure where the `Collision` property could receive an object of another type than `CollisionObject2D` which would inevitably cause `InvalidCastexception`.
The explicit operator of the `RayHit2D` structure was also changed to avoid the same problem as the explicit operator of the `Hit2D` structure.
# [31/12/2023]#1.2.0
## Added
The `Gizmos` class has been added.
The `Gizmos` class allows you to use drawing functions statically.
# [01/01/2024]#1.2.1
## Fixed
In the static constructor of the `Screen` class it only obtained the resolutions saved in the <kbd>res://AddResolution.json</kbd> file but with the correction the <kbd>projectrootfolder://AddResolution.json</kbd> file in the root folder of the already compiled project is also obtained.
